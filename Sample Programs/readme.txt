Sample Programs
-----------------
* I usually keep these in the ..\bin\Debug\net6.0 dir for ease of execution

* If you want to debug in VS.NET go to the Properties Dialog of the current Project.  Go to "Configuration Properties|Debugging" under Command Line Arguments and add the same args you'd add on the command line.  

So, you might put 

1024 prog3.txt idle-n.txt

to have 1024 bytes of addressable memory and run prog3.txt and idle-n.txt when debugging.
